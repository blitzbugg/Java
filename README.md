# Java Practical Exam Preparation

This repository contains a collection of Java programs aimed at helping me and my freinds to prepare for our upcoming practical exam. The repository is divided into four sections: Sample Programs, OOPS Programs, Applet Programs, and Java ODBC Programs.

## 1. Sample Programs
The SamplePrograms folder contains a variety of Java programs that cover core concepts such as:

- Loops and Control Statements
- Arrays and Strings
- File Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 2. OOPS Programs
The OOPSPrograms folder contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction
- Constructors and Method Overloading
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes

## 3. Applet Programs
The AppletPrograms folder contains Java Applet programs that showcase:

- Drawing shapes
- Handling events in applets
- Animations in applets

## 4. ODBC Programs

The ODBCPrograms folder contains programs demonstrating database connectivity using Java ODBC. These programs include:

- Connecting to a database
- Executing SQL queries
- Handling result sets

## How to Run the Programs

### Sample Programs

1. Navigate to the **SamplePrograms** folder.
2. Compile the Java files using:

```
javac ProgramName.java
```
3. Run the program using:
```bash
java ProgramName
```
## OOPS Programs

1. Navigate to the **OOPSPrograms** folder.
2. Compile the Java files using:
```
javac OOPProgramName.java
```
3. Run the program using:
```
java OOPProgramName
```

## Applet Programs

1. Navigate to the **AppletPrograms** folder.
2. Compile the Applet files using:
```
javac AppletName.java
```
3. Run the applet using an applet viewer or a browser that supports applets:
```
appletviewer AppletName.java
```

## ODBC Programs

1. Ensure you have the required JDBC driver set up for ODBC connectivity.
2. Navigate to the **ODBCPrograms** folder.
3. Compile the Java ODBC files using:

```
javac ODBCProgramName.java
```
4. Run the program using:
```
java ODBCProgramName
```
